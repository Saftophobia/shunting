#Shunting Inhibitory Layers in Convolutional Neural Networks
Investigating the effect of adding Shunting Inhibitory Layers to different layers of the convolutional Neural Networks.

### Goals:
* Implementing Convolutional Neural Networks from the scratch. 
  * Understand ConvNN's Backpropagation and upsampling).
* Implement the network using [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). 
* Train the network with different paramaters. (Parameterization)
* De-convolute Hidden layers to see the effect of parameters and regularizers.
* Evaluate the Shunting Architecture on different layers in the network and measure performance.


### Dataset:
* [CMU Multi-PIE Face dataset](http://www.multipie.org/)
* [Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)

### Why?
* After 2 semesters of research papers readings, summarizing and seminaring, I wanted to acquire some practical experience.
